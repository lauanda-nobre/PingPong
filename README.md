<h1 align="center">Ping Pong</h1>

<b>This project is a Ping Pong game where you play against a bot.</b>
 
> The concept and visual style are inspired by the first Ping Pong games developed for computers, especially those created during the early decades of computer graphics.
> The purpose of this project is to explore a simple and straightforward approach, both in gameplay and technical implementation, prioritizing code clarity and component organization.

#### 1.1 Project and Implementation

The game was developed using the **p5.js** framework, which is focused on creative programming and simplifies the construction of visual elements through code.

One of the main reasons for choosing p5.js is the ability to build the entire graphical and logical structure of the game in an integrated way, using fewer lines of JavaScript code compared to more traditional approaches. In addition, the framework allows a clear separation between different game components, which contributes to better project organization.

The implementation is divided into multiple JavaScript files, where each file is responsible for a specific part of the game's functionality. This structure makes the code more readable and facilitates future modifications or expansions.

In the final execution flow, all these files are imported by a main file, which is responsible for bringing the scripts together, initializing the graphical environment, and running the game.
